# DataCar

This web application was created for a university project and serves as the the API server of the android APP (that you can also find in my github). 
Since i was running short of time, this project lacks some essentials things like JUnit tests and more accurated managment of the inputs from the clients, 
but it is more than suited to be an example project of a Java EE project.

Technologies used: Java EE, MySQL, Payara Server.
